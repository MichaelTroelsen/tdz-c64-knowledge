## [2.23.5] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Archive.org Filename Path Extraction** - Fixed FileNotFoundError for downloads and Quick Add
  - Extract only filename (not directory path) when saving files locally
  - Root Cause: Filenames like "Back in Time 3/Extras/Booklet.PDF" created non-existent subdirectories
  - Solution: Use `Path(filename).name` to extract only the last component
  - Fixed in 4 locations:
    - admin_gui.py line 3968: Search Archive Download button
    - admin_gui.py line 3988: Search Archive Quick Add temp file
    - admin_gui.py line 4248: AI Suggestions Quick Add temp file
    - admin_gui.py line 4323: AI Suggestions Download button
  - Example: "Back in Time 3/Extras/Booklet.PDF" → saved as "Booklet.PDF"
  - Impact: Downloads and Quick Add now work for all archive.org files with directory separators

### Testing
- **Filename Extraction Tests** - Added 7 new tests to test_url_encoding.py (23 total tests, 100% pass)
  - TestFilenameExtraction (7 tests): Simple paths, directory paths, multiple slashes, temp filename construction
  - **Specific test for user-reported error**: "Back in Time 3/Extras/Back in Time 3 Booklet.PDF"
  - Validates:
    - Path.name extracts only last component
    - No directory separators in extracted filenames
    - Downloads directory receives single-level filenames
    - Temp filenames don't create subdirectories
  - All tests pass on Windows (path separator agnostic)

### Changed
- **Version Bump** - Updated version from 2.23.4 to 2.23.5

### Impact
- Downloads work correctly for all archive.org file paths
- Quick Add temp file creation no longer fails with FileNotFoundError

  - Added URL encoding using `urllib.parse.quote()` for archive.org download URLs
  - Fixes `InvalidURL: URL can't contain control characters` error when downloading files
  - Root Cause: Filenames with spaces, slashes, and special characters not URL-encoded
  - Example: `Back in Time 1/Extras/BIT 1 - DD Booklet.pdf` → `Back%20in%20Time%201%2FExtras%2FBIT%201%20-%20DD%20Booklet.pdf`
  - Impact: All archive.org files now downloadable via Quick Add and Download buttons
  - Location: admin_gui.py line 3868 (URL construction in Archive Search)
  - Import: Added `from urllib.parse import quote` to module imports

### Testing

    - Filenames with spaces (encoded as %20)
    - Directory paths with slashes (encoded as %2F)
    - Special characters: & ( ) : $ % # ! @ = + ?
    - Unicode characters (Cyrillic, etc.)
    - Empty filenames and edge cases
    - Integration with urllib.request.urlretrieve()

## [2.22.0] - 2025-12-23

### Added

#### 🧠 Enhanced Entity Intelligence

- **C64-Specific Regex Entity Patterns** - Instant, no-cost entity detection
  - 18 hardware patterns (VIC-II, SID, CIA1/2, 6502, 6510, KERNAL, BASIC, etc.)
  - 3 memory address formats with high confidence:
    - `$D000` format (99% confidence)
    - `0xD000` hexadecimal (98% confidence)
    - Decimal addresses like `53280` (85% confidence)
  - 56 6502 instruction opcodes (LDA, STA, JMP, JSR, ADC, etc.)
  - 15 C64 concept patterns (sprites, raster interrupts, character sets, etc.)
  - **5000x faster** than LLM-only extraction (~1ms vs ~5s)
  - Hybrid extraction strategy: Regex for well-known patterns + LLM for complex cases

- **Entity Normalization** - Consistent entity representation
  - New method: `_normalize_entity_text()` for standardization
  - Hardware normalization: VIC II / VIC 2 / VIC-II → VIC-II
  - Memory address normalization: $d020 → $D020, 0xd020 → $D020
  - Instruction normalization: lda → LDA
  - Concept singularization: sprites → sprite
  - **Impact:** Better cross-document entity matching and deduplication

- **Entity Source Tracking** - Know where entities came from
  - Tracks extraction source: `regex`, `llm`, or `both`
  - Confidence boosting when multiple sources agree
  - Regex-detected entities have higher baseline confidence
  - LLM entities validated by regex get confidence boost
  - Enables filtering by extraction quality and reliability

#### 📈 Enhanced Relationship Intelligence

- **Distance-Based Relationship Strength** - Proximity matters
  - Exponential decay weighting based on character distance
  - Decay factor: 500 characters
  - Adjacent entities (same sentence): ~0.95 strength
  - Distant entities (different paragraphs): ~0.40 strength
  - More meaningful relationship graphs and analytics

- **Logarithmic Normalization** - Better score distribution
  - Log-scale normalization: `log(1 + strength) / log(1 + max_strength)`
  - Avoids linear compression of relationship scores
  - More interpretable relationship strengths
  - Better visual representation in network graphs

#### 🔬 Performance Benchmarking Suite

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-12

### Added - Priority 1 Improvements

#### 🎯 Hybrid Search
- **New Method:** `hybrid_search(query, max_results, tags, semantic_weight)` combines FTS5 keyword search with semantic search
- **Configurable Weighting:** Adjust balance between keyword precision and semantic recall (default: 70% FTS5, 30% semantic)
- **Score Normalization:** Both search types normalized to 0-1 range for fair comparison
- **Result Merging:** Intelligent merging of results from both search backends
- **MCP Tool:** New `hybrid_search` tool available in Claude Desktop integration
- **Benefits:**
  - Best of both worlds: exact keyword matching AND conceptual understanding
  - Better handles technical terms + synonyms simultaneously
  - Example: "6502 assembler" finds exact matches AND related content about machine code, opcodes

**Usage:**
```python
# Python API
results = kb.hybrid_search("SID chip sound", max_results=5, semantic_weight=0.3)

# Via MCP in Claude Desktop
# "Use hybrid search to find information about graphics sprites"
```

#### ✨ Enhanced Snippet Extraction
- **Term Density Scoring:** Sliding window analysis finds regions with highest query term concentration
- **Complete Sentences:** Expands to sentence boundaries instead of hard cutoffs
- **Code Block Preservation:** Detects and preserves complete code blocks (indented lines)
- **Whole Word Highlighting:** Uses word boundaries for better highlighting accuracy
- **Better Context:** More relevant snippets with natural boundaries

**Improvements:**
- No more mid-sentence cuts
- Better context around search terms
- Code snippets preserved intact
- 80% snippet size threshold ensures adequate context

#### 🏥 Health Monitoring
