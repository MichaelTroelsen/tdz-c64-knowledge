## README.md vs README_UPDATED.md

### File Stats
| File | Size | Last Modified | Version |
|------|------|---------------|---------|
| **README.md** (CURRENT) | 13,297 bytes | 2026-01-01 | v2.23.1 |
| **README_UPDATED.md** (OLD) | 13,610 bytes | 2025-12-17 | v2.12.0 |

### Key Differences

**README.md (CURRENT) has:**
- ✅ Version 2.23.1 (up to date)
- ✅ RAG question answering feature (Phase 2 - v2.23.0)
- ✅ Fuzzy search feature (Phase 2 - v2.23.0)
- ✅ Smart tagging feature (Phase 2 - v2.23.0)
- ✅ Progressive refinement (Phase 2 - v2.23.0)
- ✅ Complete REST API documentation (27 endpoints)
- ✅ Accurate performance stats (5,712 queries/sec)
- ✅ Entity extraction improvements (5000x faster)
- ✅ Anomaly detection (ML-based, 3400+ docs/sec)
- ✅ Better troubleshooting section
- ✅ Cleaner, more modern formatting
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline badge

**README_UPDATED.md (OLD) has:**
- ❌ Version 2.12.0 (outdated - 11 versions behind!)
- ❌ References to "launch-gui-full-features.bat" (doesn't exist)
- ❌ References to "launch-cli-full-features.bat" (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Outdated stats (148 docs - not current)
- ❌ Missing Phase 2 features (RAG, fuzzy search, smart tagging)
- ❌ "Fully Configured & Operational" status (unnecessary marketing)
- ❌ Verbose feature tables (harder to scan)

### Recommendation: ❌ DELETE README_UPDATED.md

**Reasoning:**
- 11 versions outdated (v2.12.0 vs v2.23.1)
- Missing critical Phase 2 features added in v2.23.0
- References non-existent .bat launcher files
- Current README.md is more complete and accurate
- No unique valuable content worth preserving

## QUICKSTART.md vs QUICKSTART_UPDATED.md

### File Stats
| File | Size | Last Modified |
|------|------|---------------|
| **QUICKSTART.md** (CURRENT) | 7,564 bytes | 2025-12-21 |
| **QUICKSTART_UPDATED.md** (OLD) | 9,711 bytes | 2025-12-17 |

### Key Differences

**QUICKSTART.md (CURRENT) has:**
- ✅ Standard installation process (git clone → venv → pip install)
- ✅ `claude mcp add` command (modern approach)
- ✅ `pip install -e .` installation
- ✅ More technical, developer-focused
- ✅ Accurate feature list (includes v2.23.0 features)
- ✅ Web UI mentioned (Streamlit)
- ✅ REST API quick start
- ✅ CLI examples with actual commands
- ✅ Simpler, cleaner structure

**QUICKSTART_UPDATED.md (OLD) has:**
- ❌ References "launch-gui-full-features.bat" (doesn't exist)
- ❌ References "launch-cli-full-features.bat" (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Three "paths" approach (GUI/CLI/Claude) - confusing
- ❌ Assumes project is already installed (no installation steps!)
- ❌ More hand-holding, emoji-heavy (not professional)
- ❌ Doesn't show how to actually install the project
- ❌ Outdated environment variable list

### Recommendation: ❌ DELETE QUICKSTART_UPDATED.md

**Reasoning:**
- References non-existent launcher scripts (.bat files)
- Missing installation instructions (assumes already installed)
- Current QUICKSTART.md has proper setup flow
- More verbose but less useful
- Outdated (doesn't include v2.23.0+ features)
